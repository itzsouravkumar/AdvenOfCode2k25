# Day 1: Advent of Code 2025

## Task 1: Safe Dial Password Calculation

### Approach
My approach is simple: I will take the input file and parse all the lines, considering each line as input for rotations and number of steps to move.

I am doing this in JavaScript.

### Algorithm
1. Read the input file line by line.
2. For each line, split the line into direction (L or R) and number of steps.
3. Initialize the starting position of the dial at 0.
4. For each instruction, update the position based on the direction and steps.
5. Use modulo operation to ensure the position wraps around the dial (0-9).

### Implementation
Let's implement and see what happens line by line.

```javascript
// Read input from file
const fs = require('fs');
const input = fs.readFileSync('Day-1/task1_input.txt', 'utf-8').trim().split('\n'); // It will read the input from 'task1_input.txt' file and split it into lines

let dialPosition = 50; // Starting position
let zeroCount = 0; // Count of times the dial points at 0

// Now our input variable contains the lines from the file and our approach will be simple
input.forEach(line => { // Here we iterate through each line of the input
    const direction = line[0]; // Get the direction (L or R)
    const distance = parseInt(line.slice(1), 10); // Get the distance and convert it to an integer
    if(direction === 'L') {
        dialPosition = (dialPosition - distance + 100) % 100; // Rotate left
    } else if(direction === 'R') {
        dialPosition = (dialPosition + distance) % 100; // Rotate right
    }
    if(dialPosition === 0) {
        zeroCount++; // Increment count if dial points at 0
    }
});

console.log(zeroCount); // Output the result
```

### Result
Result for my input is **1172**.

## Task 2: First Repeated Dial Position

3. Initialize the starting position of the dial at 0.
4. Count zeros during each step of rotation, not just after completing each instruction.

### Implementation
```javascript
### Algorithm:
1. Read the input file line by line.
2. For each line, split the line into direction (L or R) and number of steps.
3. Initialize the starting position of the dial at 0.
4. Use a set to keep track of visited positions.
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const input = fs.readFileSync('Day-1/task2_input.txt', 'utf-8').trim().split('\n'); // It will read the input from 'task2_input.txt' file and split it into lines

// In this task, we need to count how many times the dial points at 0, including during rotations
let dialPosition = 50;
let zeroCount = 0;

// Improvement is to count zeros during the rotation itself
input.forEach(line => { // Here we iterate through each line of the input
    const direction = line[0]; // Get the direction (L or R)
    const distance = parseInt(line.slice(1), 10); // Get the distance and convert it to an integer
    if(direction === 'L') {
        // Count zeros during left rotation
        for(let i = 1; i <= distance; i++) { // Rotate one step at a time
            dialPosition = (dialPosition - 1 + 100) % 100; // Rotate left by 1
            if(dialPosition === 0) {
                zeroCount++;
            }
        }
    } else if(direction === 'R') {
        for(let i = 1; i <= distance; i++) { // Rotate one step at a time
console.log(zeroCount); 
```

### Result
Result for my input is **6932**.

## Summary
Day 1 tasks completed successfully! Both parts involved tracking dial positions with rotations, with Task 2 requiring more granular tracking during the rotation process itself.
    }
});

console.log(zeroCount); 
``` 
Result for my input is 6932.

Here, Day1 task is completed.
